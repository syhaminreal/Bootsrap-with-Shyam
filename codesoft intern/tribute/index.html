      <h2>About the Show</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Silicon Valley</strong> is an American comedy television series created by Mike Judge, John Altschuler, and Dave Krinsky. The show aired on HBO from 2014 to 2019 and follows a group of programmers trying to make it big in the high-stakes world of tech startups in Silicon Valley, California.
      </p>
      <p>
        With clever satire, nerdy references, and iconic characters like Richard Hendricks, Erlich Bachman, and Gilfoyle, the show is both hilarious and brutally accurate about the startup culture.
